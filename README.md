# Aperture_coded_imaging
Code base for "Beams Vs Bandwidth: Imaging with randomized beamforming"




1. To perform simulations for target scenes at a constant range, run ConstRange.m

2. To perform simulations for target scenes with multiple depths and when the range profile is known, run imagingWithKnownDepth.m


3. To perform simulations for target scenes with multiple depths and when the range profile is unknown, CoSaMP_2DImages_ApCoding.m

4. To perform simulations for 3D target scenes, run Imaging_3D.m 


%% Note that all the progarms currently run on the data files provided in this repo: Shapes.png, GT_texture2.mat and  img3d.mat

%% To use different image files, the code has to be altered correspondingly.
